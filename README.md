# CODESOFT--Image-Captioning-AI
An AI project that combines computer vision and NLP to generate captions for images. It uses a pre-trained ResNet model to extract image features and an LSTM-based decoder to generate human-like descriptions. Ideal for understanding how machines interpret visuals and convert them into natural language.
